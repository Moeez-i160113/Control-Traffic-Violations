Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Installing Dependencies
1. Node.JS
Needed to configure your environment for developing smart contracts. The first dependency you'll need is Node Package Manager, or NPM, which comes with Node.js.

2. Truffle Framework
It provides a suite of tools for developing Ethereum smart contacts with the Solidity programming language. 
Install it by typing:


$ npm install -g truffle@5.0.5


3. Metamask Ethereum Wallet
To turn web browser into a blockchain browser. Most major web browsers do not currently connect to blockchain networks, so we'll have to install a browser extension that allows them to do this.

Now you need to install Metamask extension for your respective web Browser. For Chrome you can get it from Chrome Web Store. 
Configure the metamask extension with the tutorial provided. 
After setting up, change network status from localhost to “Ropsten test network”. Contracts are deployed on Ropsten, so a web3 connection will be established with the Ropsten and contracts will be downloaded. The accounts and private keys are pre-configured inside the code. So dont worry about it!


4. You can go ahead and install your dependencies like this:

$ npm install

5. Next you need to build your code: 
$ npm run build

6. Then just start by:
